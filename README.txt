Book Reading system, it is presenting books with its properties and reviews which is added by users, and it do search functionality and the user can add a new book to this system, and finally for each user there is a to read list that he can select books and add them to list and read them and when he finish it remove the book from the list.
- What does it do?  
  Example: "This is a web project which allow user to make to read list."

- What is the "new feature" which you have implemented that we haven't seen before?  
  Example: "reading from json file", "adding images", "sending values to the route to use it", "deleting from file" , "using jinja to display elemnts"

## Prerequisites
Did you add any additional modules that someone needs to install (for instance anything in Python that you `pip install-ed`)? 
List those here (if any).
jinja in visual studio code

## Project Checklist

It uses `__init__()` to let the class initialize the object's attributes (note that  `__init__()` doesn't count as a method). This includes instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of at least one example of a class definition in your code as well as the names of two properties and two methods.
  - File name for the class definition: Books
  - Line number(s) for the class definition: line 165
  - Name of two properties: name, author
  - Name of two methods: addthem, addname
  - File name and line numbers where the methods are used: main.py , line 169
- [yes] It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the localStorage of the web browser.
- [yes] It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const rather than var).
- [yes] It makes use of the reading and writing to the same file feature.

- [yes] It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some point.
  This value is received and processed by your back end Python code.
